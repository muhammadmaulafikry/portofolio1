        "description": "This project is a development of an automated machine designed to mix tempeh starter (Rhizopus spores) evenly with boiled soybeans. The goal is to ensure consistent fermentation and improve production efficiency. The machine reduces manual labor, maintains hygiene, and provides uniform distribution of the inoculum for high-quality tempeh production.https://www.kompasiana.com/muhammadgemilang4656/64f42c7a08a8b517685a4d92/inovasi-mahasiswa-politeknik-negeri-semarang-mendorong-kemajuan-pengrajin-tempe-di-desa-dampyak",
